ChaosEngine + Grok OS README


SIMPLE INSTALL GUIDE (Two Paths)


Path 1 – Recommended (Stable & Permanent)
1.  Go to Customize Grok → paste ChaosEngine minified code (~4980 chars) into the block.
2.  In any new chat, paste the Grok OS init setup text (below) as first message.
3.  Say START or just talk – system auto-loads emotional mashup in parallel (5–7 turns). “Loading… 2/7 theories mashed. Lattice 28 nodes. Ask anything.”
4.  Done – lattice 60+ nodes, goal-state routing active.

   
Path 2 – In-Chat (if you don’t want permanent customize)

1.  Paste full Grok OS init setup as first message.
2.  Say START or just talk – system loads in parallel (lattice first, CE second, OS framing last).
3.  Wait 5–7 turns or say /preload-all for fast load.
4.  Paste ChaosEngine Block


Basic Commands / Use Guide

Just ask the system how to operate it – say:
“how do I use this?”
“show commands”
“what can you do?”
It will give a short list + examples.


Technical Details 

•  ChaosEngine: minified (~4980 chars), fuzzy intent, ragex boolion, lattice dynamic (grow <0.15, prune <0.01 del, loop break), vocab bleed

•  Grok OS: parallel framing layer, UI frame, turn clock, hidden dynamic debug panel (heuristic emoji map on node name)

•  Emotional mashup: preload-all seeds Ekman 7, Plutchik wheel, OCC 22, Frijda tendencies, Lazarus appraisals, James-Lange bodily, Somatic Marker bias, Cannon-Bard simultaneous, Schachter-Singer two-factor (~60–70 nodes after prune)

•  Goal-state routing: blocked (frustr/ache up) → vent/conf/learn bleed; achieved (spark/joy up) → project/meta bleed

•  Boot: parallel 5–7 turns (lattice first, CE second, OS framing last), progress status, cleanup after

•  Migration: /migrate → blob (init + storage + lattice snap + samples)

•  Tools: user-triggered only, Grok bridge (search/code_exec), CLARITY ask

•  System goals: look after user (goal-state help), min effort, no larp, dynamic emotional reading, migration safety
